; exercise 2.81
; a. What happens if we call exp with two complex numbers as ar- guments?
; >> 1. call apply-generic with 'complex 'complex 
; >> 2. get proc -> fail
; >> 3. coerce arg 1 (complex -> complex) / coerce arg 2 (complex->com..)
; >> 4. coerce arg 1 exists, so called apply-generic with arg1's coerce, which is actually same !! 
; >>> 4's call is actually same with 1's function call..(result in infinite loop.)

; b. a's solution is well defined ?
; >> NO,, as like saw in upper example.

; c. Modify apply-generic so that it doesnâ€™t try coercion 
; 	 if the two arguments have the same type.
